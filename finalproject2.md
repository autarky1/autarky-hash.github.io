##Rendering
I rendered the carla trailer by going to the Standard Settings -> Typing in _Shade -> Turning off the Grid Lines -> going to Panel and then selecting Render -> Going back to Shade view port and selecting the Blue Dot. Then I modified the shade settings by adding a color gradient (Orange + Blue) and changing the material to a Metal (Steel) in the color of orange.

Then I converted the setitngs into RayTrace where I got a clearer image.

##Measuring with Calipers

I measured the width of the cargo trailer as 49.49mm and the length as 120.60 mm. Height of 12.77 mm



## Final Project Proposal
Create a proposal pitch for your final project. Your pitch should include a concept, including concept sketches, intended use case, context, a rendering, a breakdown of tasks (e.g. CAD modelling, 3d printing, casting, finishing), a timeline with contingency plans, a Bill of Materials with sourcing schedule
Your proposal can be for any digitally fabricated object. Your plan must include several of the techniques we learned in class, e.g. Rhino, Grasshopper, Slicing, Printing, Casting, Rendering, etc.
Document your proposal on a webpage linked to from your main webpage. You will present your proposal in class next week using your documentation. 
You are encouraged to work together but all work submitted must be your own. Please list your collaborators and peer-teachers in your documentation acknowledgements. If you use external sources (e.g. for images) please attribute them.

## Concept (The "UnLego")
In researching my final project and trying to piece together prototype pieces for a bike that I can put together in 2 weeks to show my concept, I actually discovered I had another problem- the inherent lack of prototyping pieces that adults can use that would reasonably translate into a final product. The only way I can make a table or bike or a version of a vehicle would be to print and design each piece, which does not allow me to experiemnt or build or play around with the final result physically. I tried to look at lego pieces but nothing in real life are actually lego pieces.

My concept is to make building blocks that would translate into real life measurements for designers and tinkerers to actually be able to build out their ideas. I would like to build basically, life-size legos in 1 inched increments that can be snapped together to make basically made-to-measure real life furniture, equipment and things. Similar to legos, I do not want to use glue- I want to use magnetic inserts on each corner of the block to get each side to connect.

## Use Case
I want to make modular furniture/pieces from my 3D printer (and potentially supplemented from my glowforge) that can be either used as a shelf wrap around a weird fireplace column in my house, a stool or a table for my Glowforge. Due to the fact that this will sit in my house, it will need to be 1) able to support some weight, 2) be aesthetically pleasing. I plan on using wood chips inlayed into resin to look like less of a resin table. I also may want to experiment with "holes" to reduce the weight needed.

MY low bar goal is to make a miniatiarized table that can be snapped together with magnets as a proof of concept. My SUPER low bar is to just make the blocks but not assemble them into products.

My medium bar goal is to make a small (low number of blocks) item like a small shelf.

My high bar goal is to make a table for my glowforge.

## Rendering
I have not completed the rendering yet but I'm envisioning that it will look similar to this:
